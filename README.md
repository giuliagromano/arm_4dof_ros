Building ROS packages to simulate a 4-degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator arm into the Gazebo environment.

Creation the description of the 4-degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator arm and visualization of it in Rviz.
Adding trasmission and controllers to the robot and spawning it in Gazebo.
Adding a camera sensor to the robot.
Creation of a ROS publisher node that reads the joint state and sends joint position commands to the
robot
